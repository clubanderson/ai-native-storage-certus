# Certus Benchmarking Plan

Two benchmark tiers serve different purposes: **trace replay** validates the storage policy layer in isolation (fast, no GPU needed), while **live serving** measures end-to-end user-facing latency under real scheduling (closed-loop, requires GPU + model).

## Replay vs Live Serving

| | Trace Replay (Tier 1) | Live Serving (Tier 2) |
|---|---|---|
| **Loop type** | Open-loop (fixed call sequence) | Closed-loop (scheduler reacts to cache state) |
| **What runs** | Just the policy layer | Full vLLM stack (model + scheduler + cache + IO) |
| **GPU needed?** | No (policy-only) / Yes (native IO) | Yes (running the model) |
| **Time to run** | Seconds (policy-only) to minutes (native IO) | Minutes to hours |
| **Answers** | "Given same keys, which policy wins?" | "What's the TTFT/throughput improvement for users?" |
| **Closed-loop feedback** | No — different decisions don't change future keys | Yes — faster loads → different scheduling → different eviction pressure |
| **Primary use** | Development, regression testing, evolution evaluator | Customer-facing benchmark |

---

## Tier 1: Trace Replay (Policy-Layer Benchmark)

**Location:** `benchmarks/kv-offload-replay/`

### What it does

Records the exact sequence of `lookup`, `touch`, `prepare_store`, `complete_store` calls that vLLM's scheduler issues to the offloading manager during a live run, then replays that sequence against alternative manager implementations.

### How traces are collected

1. `TracingOffloadingConnector` wraps vLLM's `OffloadingConnector` — intercepts every scheduler↔manager call
2. `TracingOffloadingManager` wraps the actual `OffloadingManager` — logs the 6 policy methods with full key lists as hex block hashes
3. `TracingOffloadingHandler` wraps each `OffloadingHandler` — logs data movement shape (direction, block count, timing)
4. Driver (`run_sharegpt_offloading.py`) runs `vllm bench throughput` with the tracing connectors attached

Output: `offloading_mgr_<pid>.jsonl` (manager-level, portable) + `offloading_handler_<pid>.jsonl` (handler-level)

### How replay works

`replay_offloading_traces.py` reads the JSONL trace and drives each call against a pluggable target:

| Target | What it exercises | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| `simple-lru` | Pure-Python LRU baseline | None (stdlib only) |
| `cpu-manager` | vLLM's `CPUOffloadingManager` | vLLM |
| `certus-connector` (policy-only) | Certus tiered DRAM+NVMe manager, no IO | vLLM + certus_connector |
| `certus-connector` (native) | Full SPDK DMA to NVMe | vLLM + certus_native + SPDK + NVMe |
| `fs-backend` | llmd_fs_backend (POSIX filesystem) | vLLM + torch + CUDA + storage_offload |
| Custom `module:Class` | Any OffloadingManager-shaped object | User-provided |

### What it measures

| Metric | Source | Faithfully measured? |
|---|---|---|
| Cache hit rate | Each target's `lookup` return values | Yes |
| Admission/rejection count | `prepare_store` decisions | Yes |
| Eviction count and identity | `prepare_store` evicted keys | Yes |
| Manager-layer latency (p50/p95/p99) | Wall-clock per method during replay | Yes |
| Handler throughput (MB/s) | Real IO in native mode | Yes |
| End-to-end tokens/sec | N/A | **No** (open-loop) |

### Limitation: open-loop replay

The captured call sequence is fixed from the original execution. A different manager's different hit rates would have caused different prefills, different block hashes, and different eviction pressure downstream. The replay answers:

> "Given the same key stream, how does manager X compare to manager Y?"

It does NOT answer:

> "What would end-to-end serving throughput have been with manager X?"

For the second question, use Tier 2 (live serving).

### Role in the system

Trace replay is a **development tool**, not a benchmarking deliverable:
- Validate policy logic correctness (hit rate matches expectations)
- Catch regressions (policy change → worse eviction count)
- Prove raw IO speed advantage (9× over fs-backend on writes)
- Fast iteration without GPU (policy-only mode)
- Provide evaluator signal for evolution campaigns (§ Evolution Integration)

## Tier 2: Live Serving Benchmark (End-to-End)

### What it does

Runs `vllm serve` with a configured offloading backend, drives real multi-turn HTTP traffic against it, and measures user-facing latency metrics.

### Architecture

```
Load Generator (async HTTP client)
  │  sends multi-turn requests with accumulated context
  │  measures TTFT per token stream
  ▼
vllm serve (OpenAI-compatible API)
  │  scheduler makes its own lookup/store/evict decisions
  │  prefix matching → offload/reload → prefill → decode
  ▼
Offloading Backend (Certus / CPUOffloadingSpec)
```

### What it measures

| Metric | How | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| TTFT (Time to First Token) | `t_first_token - t_request_sent` | Lower TTFT on turn 2+ proves prefix cache hit → skipped prefill |
| TTFT by turn bucket | Group by turn 1 vs 2-5 vs 6-10 vs 11+ | Shows benefit accumulation with reuse depth |
| TPOT (Time per Output Token) | `(t_last - t_first) / output_tokens` | Should be similar across backends (decode is decode) |
| Throughput (tok/s) | Total output tokens / wall time | End-to-end capacity |
| Prefix cache hit rate | vLLM `/metrics` endpoint | Confirms offload→reload is actually happening |

### Backends to compare

#### Primary (same OffloadingConnector code path — apples-to-apples)

| Backend | Configuration | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| **Certus native** | OffloadingConnector + CertusOffloadingSpec (DRAM hot cache + NVMe cold tier) | Full Certus value: larger effective cache means fewer misses |
| **CPUOffloadingSpec** (vLLM built-in) | OffloadingConnector + CPUOffloadingSpec (DRAM-only offload tier) | Fair baseline — same scheduler code path, different storage tier |
| **llm-d FS backend** | OffloadingConnector + SharedStorageOffloadingSpec (POSIX filesystem, e.g. XFS on NVMe) | Proves SPDK advantage over kernel filesystem path |
| **No offloading** (GPU-only) | No kv_transfer_config — vLLM recomputes on eviction | Worst-case baseline: what happens without any offload tier |

#### Extended (different connector architectures — competitive comparisons)

These systems use their own `KVConnectorBase_V1` implementations with different architectures (disaggregated prefill/decode, cross-instance sharing). The scheduler code path differs, so results aren't strictly apples-to-apples — but they are the systems Certus competes against in multi-node k8s deployments.

| System | vLLM Connector | Architecture | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mooncake** | `MooncakeConnector` | Disaggregated P/D with RDMA KV transfer; Mooncake Transfer Engine supports local DRAM/SSD caching | Requires RDMA fabric; competes on reload latency when KV is remote |
| **LMCache** | `LMCacheConnectorV1` | CPU offload + cross-instance KV sharing | Shares KV blocks across vLLM instances; used in llm-d |
| **3FS (HF3FS)** | `HF3FSKVConnector` | Distributed filesystem for KV sharing | High-throughput distributed FS (Fire-Flyer File System); multi-node KV persistence |
| **llm-d FS connector** | via `OffloadingConnector` | POSIX shared filesystem (NFS/Lustre/local) | Already in primary table; included here as it's the current llm-d default |

**Phasing:** Start with single-node primary comparisons (prove the storage tier wins). Once Certus runs in k8s with multi-node KV sharing (cross-node lookup/store via the llm-d routing layer), benchmark head-to-head against Mooncake and LMCache on the same cluster with the same workload. The question shifts from "which local storage is faster" to "which system delivers lower TTFT at fleet scale with N nodes sharing KV state."

### Existing tooling

The `llm-d-benchmark` repo (`util/experimental/multi-turn/production-trace-replay-qwen.py`) already implements a multi-turn serving benchmark:
- Replays Qwen production traces turn-by-turn with session context accumulation
- Uses `inference_perf` library for load generation and metrics collection
- Reports TTFT by turn bucket (Turn 1, Turns 2-5, Turns 6-10, Turns 11+)
- Sends raw `prompt_token_ids` to vLLM's Completion API

To benchmark Certus: start `vllm serve` with Certus configured, run the Qwen replay driver against it, repeat with CPUOffloadingSpec as baseline, compare TTFT by turn bucket.

## Datasets

### Comparison

| | Qwen Production Trace | ShareGPT | Shared-Prefix Synthetic | SWE-bench / ToolBench |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Source** | `qwen_traceA_blksz_16.jsonl` (Alibaba) | HuggingFace anon8231489123 | Generated by guidellm/inference-perf | HuggingFace princeton-nlp / sambanovasystems |
| **Access pattern** | Real multi-turn conversations, natural inter-arrival timing | Multi-turn chat (if replayed incrementally) | Single-turn, shared system prompt across group | Agentic: tool calls with growing shared context |
| **Prefix reuse** | High — sessions accumulate context across turns; block hashes encode real sharing structure | High (if replayed turn-by-turn) | Fixed — always the same N-token prefix per group | Very high — 10-50 calls per task sharing task prefix |
| **Eviction pressure** | Natural — many sessions interleave, old turns get evicted | Moderate (depends on GPU memory pressure) | Controlled — tune group count vs cache size | High — long contexts compete for GPU memory |
| **Context growth** | Grows per turn (turn 5 has 5× turn 1's prefix) | Grows per turn | Fixed (no growth) | Grows per tool call (accumulated results) |
| **Load path exercised?** | Yes — turn N reloads turns 1..N-1 from offload | Yes (if multi-turn) | Yes — request 2+ reloads shared prefix | Yes — tool call N reloads task context |
| **Realism** | Production traffic from Alibaba Qwen serving | Real conversations but synthetic replay timing | Synthetic but representative of RAG/chatbot | Real agentic tasks |
| **Best for** | Primary end-to-end benchmark; proves value of NVMe tier under real concurrency | Validating multi-turn replay driver | Quick sanity check; confirms prefix caching works at all | Proving Certus value for agentic workloads (killer use case) |
| **Limitation** | Alibaba-specific model/traffic; may not represent agentic patterns | Flat if not replayed incrementally | Doesn't stress tiering (small prefixes may fit in DRAM) | No published KV-level traces yet; requires live instrumented run |

### Qwen Production Trace (Primary)

The trace contains real production traffic from Alibaba's Qwen model serving. Each line encodes:

```json
{"timestamp": 1234.5, "hash_ids": [101, 202, 303, ...], "chat_id": 42, "parent_chat_id": 17, "output_length": 64, "turn": 3}
```

- `hash_ids` are block-level content hashes from Alibaba's production prefix cache — requests sharing hash_ids share KV cache blocks
- `parent_chat_id` links turns into sessions — the replay driver accumulates context across turns
- `timestamp` preserves original inter-arrival timing
- The replay driver converts each `hash_id` → 16 deterministic tokens, so shared hashes produce shared token prefixes

This is the most valuable dataset because it encodes real prefix-sharing structure without leaking user data. Sessions interleave naturally, creating realistic eviction pressure on the offload tier.

**Availability:** `wget https://github.com/alibaba-edu/qwen-bailian-usagetraces-anon/raw/refs/heads/main/qwen_traceA_blksz_16.jsonl`

### Shared-Prefix Synthetic (Smoke Test)

Generated by `guidellm` with parameters:

```yaml
prefix_tokens: 2048    # shared system prompt per group
prefix_count: 32       # distinct prefix groups
prompt_tokens: 256     # unique user question
output_tokens: 256
```

Useful for confirming prefix caching works at all. Not sufficient for proving NVMe tier value — 32 groups × 2048 tokens likely fits entirely in DRAM.

### SWE-bench / ToolBench (Agentic — Future)

Agentic workloads are Certus's killer use case: 10-50 LLM calls per task, each appending tool results to a growing shared context. This creates the access pattern where NVMe offloading provides maximum benefit:

- Long shared prefixes (thousands of tokens of file/task context)
- High reuse within a session (every tool call reloads the task prefix)
- Ephemeral leaves (tool results processed once, never reused)
- Bursty arrivals (parallel tool calls within one agent step)

No published KV-level traces exist yet. To produce them: run SWE-bench tasks through vLLM with TracingOffloadingConnector attached, or instrument a live agentic system.

## Evolution Integration

Trace replay serves as the **evaluator** for LLM-driven code evolution campaigns (see `adaptive-evolution-proposal.md`). The evolution loop:

1. LLM proposes a mutation to the eviction policy (Rust or Python)
2. Build + test (fast-fail on compile/test errors)
3. **Replay traces** against the mutated policy → score = `0.4 × hit_ratio + 0.3 × (1/p99) + 0.3 × ops_per_sec`
4. Score feeds back to the evolution framework (SkyDiscover, GEPA, K-Search, etc.)

Trace replay is ideal for this because:
- Fast feedback (~1s per evaluation in Python, ~30s with cargo bench)
- Deterministic (same trace = same score for same policy)
- Safe (LLM-generated code that panics doesn't crash the model server)
- Isolatable (policy layer only, no GPU/network/scheduling noise)

The live serving benchmark is used for **validation** after evolution converges — confirming that the evolved policy's trace-replay advantage translates to real TTFT improvement.
