# Feature Specification: Dispatcher Cache Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-dispatcher-cache-interface`  
**Created**: 2026-04-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Dispatcher component providing IDispatcher interface with cache management methods for GPU-to-SSD data flows"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Cache Population (GPU to SSD) (Priority: P1)

A client application holds data in GPU memory and wants to cache it for future use. The client calls the dispatcher's populate method, providing a cache key and an IPC handle referencing the GPU memory region. The dispatcher registers the element in the dispatch map, allocates a CPU staging buffer, initiates a DMA copy from GPU memory into the staging buffer, and returns confirmation to the client. In the background, the dispatcher asynchronously writes the staging buffer contents to the SSD via the block device and extent manager, then frees the staging buffer.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary write path — without the ability to populate the cache, no data enters the system. Every other operation depends on cached data existing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by populating a cache entry with a known key and verifying that the dispatch map contains the entry and that the data eventually reaches the block device. Delivers the core caching capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dispatcher is initialized with all receptacles bound, **When** populate(key, ipc_handle) is called with a new key, **Then** a staging buffer is allocated, DMA copy from GPU is initiated, and the call returns success before the SSD write completes.
2. **Given** a populate call returned successfully, **When** the background SSD write completes, **Then** the dispatch map entry transitions from staging to block-device state and the staging buffer is freed.
3. **Given** the dispatcher is initialized, **When** populate(key, ipc_handle) is called with a key that already exists, **Then** an appropriate error is returned indicating duplicate key.

---

### User Story 2 - Cache Lookup with DMA Transfer (Priority: P1)

A client application needs to retrieve previously cached data into GPU memory. The client calls the dispatcher's lookup method, providing the cache key and an IPC handle for the destination GPU memory. The dispatcher queries the dispatch map; if the data is in a staging buffer, it initiates a DMA copy from the staging buffer to GPU memory. If the data is on SSD, it reads from the block device and transfers to GPU memory. The client receives the data.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary read path. The cache is only useful if data can be retrieved. Lookup is the most latency-sensitive operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by first populating a cache entry, then looking it up and verifying the DMA transfer to the client's memory occurs with correct data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cache entry exists in staging state, **When** lookup(key, ipc_handle) is called, **Then** a DMA copy from the staging buffer to the GPU memory region is performed and success is returned.
2. **Given** a cache entry exists in block-device state (SSD), **When** lookup(key, ipc_handle) is called, **Then** data is read from the SSD at the recorded offset and DMA-copied to the GPU memory region.
3. **Given** no cache entry exists for the key, **When** lookup(key, ipc_handle) is called, **Then** a cache-miss indication is returned.

---

### User Story 3 - Cache Presence Check (Priority: P2)

A client application wants to check whether a cache entry exists without transferring any data. The client calls the dispatcher's check method with a cache key. The dispatcher queries the dispatch map and returns whether the key is present.

**Why this priority**: Enables clients to make decisions about whether to populate or look up data without incurring DMA transfer costs. Important for efficiency but not required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by checking a non-existent key (returns not present), populating a key, then checking again (returns present).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cache entry exists for the key, **When** check(key) is called, **Then** the result indicates the entry is present.
2. **Given** no cache entry exists for the key, **When** check(key) is called, **Then** the result indicates the entry is not present.

---

### User Story 4 - Cache Entry Removal (Priority: P2)

A client application wants to evict a cache entry. The client calls the dispatcher's remove method with a cache key. The dispatcher frees the associated staging buffer (if data has not yet been written to SSD) or frees the extent on the SSD (if data has been committed). The dispatch map entry is removed.

**Why this priority**: Cache eviction is necessary for cache management and preventing resource exhaustion. Required for long-running workloads but not for basic single-use caching.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by populating an entry, removing it, then verifying the key is no longer present and resources have been freed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cache entry exists in staging state, **When** remove(key) is called, **Then** the staging buffer is freed and the dispatch map entry is removed.
2. **Given** a cache entry exists in block-device state, **When** remove(key) is called, **Then** the extent is freed via the extent manager and the dispatch map entry is removed.
3. **Given** no cache entry exists for the key, **When** remove(key) is called, **Then** an appropriate error is returned.

---

### User Story 5 - Dispatcher Initialization and Wiring (Priority: P1)

A system integrator wires the dispatcher component to its dependencies: a logger, dispatch map, GPU services, and SPDK environment. The integrator provides PCI BDF address strings for the metadata and data block devices via `DispatcherConfig`. The dispatcher internally creates N block device components and N extent managers, wiring them to the shared SPDK environment and logger. After initialization, the dispatcher is ready to serve cache operations. If the SPDK environment receptacle is not connected, the dispatcher operates in staging-only mode (no block devices or extent managers).

**Why this priority**: Without correct initialization and wiring, no cache operations can proceed. This is the prerequisite for all other stories.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by wiring all receptacles and calling initialize, verifying that the dispatcher transitions to an operational state and that extent managers are correctly configured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dispatcher component is created, **When** logger, dispatch_map, gpu_services, and spdk_env receptacles are bound, **Then** initialize succeeds, N block devices and N extent managers are created internally, and the dispatcher is ready for cache operations.
2. **Given** the dispatcher component is created, **When** initialize is called without the dispatch_map receptacle bound, **Then** an error is returned indicating the missing dependency.
3. **Given** initialization succeeds, **When** shutdown is called, **Then** all background writes complete, block devices are shut down in reverse order, and resources are released.

---

### User Story 6 - Direct Store Workflow (prepare/commit/cancel) (Priority: P2)

A caller wants to write data directly to SSD without going through the GPU DMA staging path. The caller calls `prepare_store(key, size)` which runs eviction if needed, reserves an SSD extent, and returns a DMA buffer. The caller writes data into the buffer, then calls `commit_store(key)` to write the buffer to SSD and publish the extent, or `cancel_store(key)` to abort.

**Why this priority**: Enables alternative ingestion paths (e.g., host-to-SSD) that bypass the GPU DMA requirement, broadening the use cases for the cache.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling prepare_store, writing data into the returned buffer, calling commit_store, and verifying the entry is accessible via check/lookup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dispatcher is initialized, **When** `prepare_store(key, size)` is called with a new key, **Then** an extent is reserved on the target drive and a DMA buffer of at least `size` bytes (block-aligned) is returned. The key is visible via `check()`.
2. **Given** a pending write exists for key, **When** `commit_store(key)` is called, **Then** the buffer contents are written to SSD, the extent is published, the dispatch map entry transitions to block-device state, and the write reference is released.
3. **Given** a pending write exists for key, **When** `cancel_store(key)` is called, **Then** the extent reservation is aborted (WriteHandle dropped), the dispatch map entry is removed, and no SSD write occurs.
4. **Given** `prepare_store` is called with a key that already exists, **Then** `AlreadyExists` error is returned.
5. **Given** `commit_store` or `cancel_store` is called with a key that has no pending write, **Then** `KeyNotFound` error is returned.

---

### User Story 7 - Cache Eviction (Priority: P2)

When the cache exceeds its configured capacity, the dispatcher must evict old entries to make room for new ones. Eviction is triggered by `prepare_store` and removes the least-recently-used entries (by TSC timestamp) until the count drops to the configured watermark.

**Why this priority**: Without eviction, the cache fills up and no new entries can be stored. Required for long-running workloads.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a low max_cache_entries, populating past the threshold, calling prepare_store, and verifying that old entries are removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `max_cache_entries=10` and `eviction_threshold=0.5` (watermark=5), **When** 8 entries exist and `prepare_store` is called, **Then** entries are evicted down to 5 before the new entry is created.
2. **Given** entries with active write references, **When** eviction runs, **Then** those entries are skipped (not evicted).
3. **Given** `max_cache_entries=0`, **When** entries accumulate, **Then** no eviction occurs (eviction is disabled).

---

### User Story 8 - Touch (Refresh Eviction Priority) (Priority: P3)

A client wants to indicate that a cache entry is still in use without performing any data transfer. The client calls `touch(key)` to refresh the entry's eviction timestamp, preventing it from being selected as a victim.

**Why this priority**: Touch enables efficient LRU-style eviction policies without the overhead of a full lookup (which involves DMA or reference management).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by populating entries, touching one, triggering eviction, and verifying the touched entry survives.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cache entry exists for the key, **When** `touch(key)` is called, **Then** the entry's TSC timestamp is refreshed and the call returns success. No DMA or reference management occurs.
2. **Given** no cache entry exists for the key, **When** `touch(key)` is called, **Then** `KeyNotFound` error is returned.

---

### Edge Cases

- When DMA buffer allocation fails during populate (out of memory), populate returns an allocation failure error to the caller and no dispatch map entry is created.
- When a populate is in progress (staging phase) and a lookup is called for the same key, the lookup blocks until the populate releases its write reference (per dispatch map read/write locking semantics), then serves from the staging buffer or SSD depending on current state.
- When the SSD is full and a background write cannot allocate an extent, an error is raised, the entry is removed from the dispatch map, and the staging buffer is freed.
- When remove is called while a background SSD write is in progress, the remove blocks until the write completes (or fails), then removes the entry and frees all resources (staging buffer and/or SSD extent).
- Multiple concurrent lookups for the same key are permitted (multiple read references allowed by dispatch map locking semantics).
- When the block device reports an I/O error during a background write, an error is raised, the entry is removed from the dispatch map, and the staging buffer is freed (same handling as SSD-full).
- When `prepare_store` fails after registering in the dispatch map (e.g., extent allocation failure), the dispatch map entry is cleaned up before returning the error.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-04-28

- Q: Are cache entries fixed-size or variable-size, and what bounds apply? → A: Variable-size entries, bounded by the extent manager's configured max extent size (default 1 GiB).
- Q: What happens when the SSD is full during a background write from staging? → A: An error is raised. The entry is removed from the dispatch map and the staging buffer is freed.
- Q: What happens when the block device reports an I/O error during a background write? → A: Same as SSD-full — raise error, remove entry from dispatch map, free staging buffer.
- Q: What happens when remove is called during an in-flight background write? → A: Remove blocks until the background write completes (or fails), then removes the entry and frees all resources.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST define an `IDispatcher` interface in the shared interfaces crate, providing `initialize`, `shutdown`, `lookup`, `check`, `remove`, `populate`, `prepare_store`, `commit_store`, `cancel_store`, and `touch` methods.
- **FR-002**: System MUST define a `DispatcherError` error type in the shared interfaces crate, covering all failure modes (not initialized, key not found, duplicate key, I/O error, allocation failure, timeout).
- **FR-003**: The `populate(key, ipc_handle)` method MUST register the element in the dispatch map, allocate a variable-size DMA staging buffer via the dispatch map's `create_staging` method, initiate DMA copy from the client's GPU memory into the staging buffer via `IGpuServices::dma_copy_to_host`, downgrade the write reference, and enqueue an asynchronous background write job.
- **FR-004**: After a successful populate, the system MUST asynchronously write the staging buffer contents to the SSD via the block device and extent manager, transitioning the dispatch map entry from staging to block-device state.
- **FR-005**: The staging buffer MUST be freed after the asynchronous SSD write completes successfully.
- **FR-006**: The `lookup(key, ipc_handle)` method MUST query the dispatch map; if the data is in staging, perform DMA copy from staging buffer to the client's GPU memory via `IGpuServices::dma_copy_to_device`; if on SSD, read from block device and DMA-copy to the client's GPU memory.
- **FR-007**: The `lookup` method MUST return a cache-miss indication if the key does not exist in the dispatch map.
- **FR-008**: The `check(key)` method MUST return whether a cache entry exists for the given key without performing any data transfer.
- **FR-009**: The `remove(key)` method MUST free the staging buffer (if data is in staging state) or free the extent on SSD (if data is in block-device state) and remove the dispatch map entry.
- **FR-010**: The dispatcher component MUST use the component framework's `define_component!` macro and expose only the `IDispatcher` interface.
- **FR-011**: The dispatcher MUST accept receptacles for `ILogger`, `IDispatchMap`, `IGpuServices`, and `ISPDKEnv` components. Block devices and extent managers are created internally during initialization.
- **FR-012**: The `initialize` method MUST validate that the `dispatch_map` receptacle is bound before proceeding. Other receptacles (`gpu_services`) are validated lazily on first use.
- **FR-013**: The dispatcher MUST use appropriate read/write locking on the dispatch map to ensure thread safety during concurrent operations.
- **FR-014**: The `shutdown` method MUST ensure all in-flight background operations complete or are cancelled before returning.
- **FR-015**: The dispatcher MUST coordinate N data block devices with N extent managers, where each extent manager is associated with a specific metadata partition and data block device.
- **FR-016**: The dispatcher MUST pass the data block device size and computed FormatParams to each extent manager's format function. A PCI-derived unique identifier is not currently passed.
- **FR-017**: When the asynchronous background write fails (extent allocation failure or block device I/O error), the background writer silently drops the job. The dispatch map entry remains in its current state. (Known limitation: failed writes do not clean up map entries.)
- **FR-018**: The `remove(key)` method does NOT block waiting for background writes to complete. It acquires a read reference from the dispatch map and proceeds with removal immediately.
- **FR-019**: All block device I/O operations MUST be segmented to respect the device's Maximum Data Transfer Size (MDTS, typically 128 KiB). Reads and writes larger than MDTS MUST be split into multiple sequential or batched I/O operations.
- **FR-020**: The `prepare_store(key, size)` method MUST run eviction if the cache is over capacity, reserve an extent on the target data drive, register the key in the dispatch map, and return a DMA buffer for the caller to write into. MUST return `AlreadyExists` if the key exists, `AllocationFailed` if extent reservation fails, `InvalidParameter` if size is 0.
- **FR-021**: The `commit_store(key)` method MUST write the pending DMA buffer contents to SSD using MDTS-aware segmented I/O, publish the extent metadata, and transition the dispatch map entry to block-device state. MUST return `KeyNotFound` if no pending write exists.
- **FR-022**: The `cancel_store(key)` method MUST drop the pending write (aborting the extent reservation via WriteHandle destructor) and remove the dispatch map entry. MUST return `KeyNotFound` if no pending write exists.
- **FR-023**: The `touch(key)` method MUST update the entry's eviction timestamp in the dispatch map without performing any DMA transfer or acquiring any reference. MUST return `KeyNotFound` if the key does not exist.
- **FR-024**: The dispatcher MUST support configurable eviction via `DispatcherConfig::max_cache_entries` and `eviction_threshold`. When the cache exceeds the watermark (`max_cache_entries × eviction_threshold`), `prepare_store` MUST synchronously evict the oldest entries (by TSC) until the count drops to the watermark. Entries with active write references MUST be skipped during eviction.
- **FR-025**: The `DispatcherConfig` MUST support a `format_on_init` flag (default true). When false, extent managers are not reformatted on initialization, preserving on-disk data from previous sessions.
- **FR-026**: The dispatcher MUST support `BlockDeviceVersion` selection (V1, V2) via `DispatcherConfig`.
- **FR-027**: The dispatcher MUST support `ExtentManagerVersion` selection via `DispatcherConfig`.
- **FR-028**: The dispatcher MUST handle `LookupResult::MismatchSize` by returning `InvalidParameter`.
- **FR-029**: The dispatcher MUST handle `LookupResult::MemoryTier` defensively (return error in v0).
- **FR-030**: `prepare_store` MUST fall back to `libc::aligned_alloc` when SPDK DMA allocation fails.
- **FR-031**: `initialize` MUST reject an empty `data_pci_addrs` list with `InvalidParameter`.

### Key Entities

- **CacheKey**: A 64-bit identifier for cached data elements. Used to address entries in the dispatch map.
- **IPC Handle**: An opaque reference to a GPU memory region provided by the client for DMA transfers.
- **Staging Buffer**: A CPU-accessible DMA buffer used as an intermediate store between GPU memory and SSD storage. Variable-size, bounded by the extent manager's max extent size.
- **Dispatch Map Entry**: A record tracking the state of a cached element — whether it is in staging (CPU buffer) or committed to a block device (SSD offset).
- **Extent**: A contiguous region on a data block device, managed by the extent manager, used to store committed cache data.
- **Data Block Device**: An NVMe SSD that holds cached data. There are N data block devices in the system.
- **Metadata Block Device**: An NVMe SSD with partitions (namespaces) that holds metadata for the extent managers.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A client can populate a cache entry and subsequently retrieve it via lookup, receiving the correct data, within a single session.
- **SC-002**: Cache check operations return accurate presence information for both existing and non-existing keys.
- **SC-003**: Cache removal frees all associated resources (staging buffers and SSD extents) so that they can be reused.
- **SC-004**: The dispatcher correctly handles concurrent populate and lookup operations on different keys without data corruption or deadlock.
- **SC-005**: Initialization fails gracefully with a descriptive error when required dependencies are not bound.
- **SC-006**: Shutdown completes all in-flight background writes before returning, ensuring no data loss.
- **SC-007**: The dispatcher supports N independent data block devices and extent managers operating in parallel.
- **SC-008**: The prepare_store/commit_store workflow successfully persists data to SSD and makes it retrievable via lookup.
- **SC-009**: Eviction correctly removes the oldest entries when the cache exceeds its configured capacity, and entries with active references are not evicted.
- **SC-010**: The touch operation refreshes an entry's eviction timestamp without performing DMA or modifying reference counts.

## Assumptions

- Clients provide valid IPC handles referencing accessible GPU memory regions. The dispatcher does not validate GPU memory accessibility.
- The SPDK environment is initialized and active before the dispatcher's `initialize()` is called (via the ISPDKEnv receptacle).
- DMA buffer allocation is delegated to the dispatch map via `create_staging()` and to the extent managers via a `DmaAllocFn` closure bound at initialization.
- A fixed timeout of 100ms is used for blocking operations. Variable per-call timeouts are not supported.
- Block devices and extent managers are created internally during `initialize()` — callers provide PCI BDF address strings, not pre-constructed components.
- GPU-to-CPU DMA transfers use `IGpuServices::dma_copy_to_host` (populate direction). CPU-to-GPU DMA transfers use `IGpuServices::dma_copy_to_device` (lookup direction).
- NVMe SSDs have a Maximum Data Transfer Size (MDTS) limit, typically 128 KiB. The `io_segmenter` module provides MDTS-aware I/O splitting.
- When the ISPDKEnv receptacle is not connected, the dispatcher operates in staging-only mode (no persistent storage). This enables unit testing without hardware.
