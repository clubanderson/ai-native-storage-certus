## Supporting Types

```rust
/// Configuration for dispatcher initialization.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct DispatcherConfig {
    /// PCI BDF address string of the metadata block device (e.g. "0000:d8:00.0").
    pub metadata_pci_addr: String,
    /// PCI BDF address strings of N data block devices (one per extent manager).
    pub data_pci_addrs: Vec<String>,
    /// Which block device component version to use (default: V2).
    pub block_device_version: BlockDeviceVersion,
    /// Which extent manager component version to use (default: V2).
    pub extent_manager_version: ExtentManagerVersion,
    /// Maximum number of cache entries before eviction begins (default: 10000).
    /// Set to 0 to disable eviction.
    pub max_cache_entries: usize,
    /// Fraction of max_cache_entries at which eviction triggers (0.0–1.0).
    /// Default: 0.8 (eviction starts at 80% capacity).
    pub eviction_threshold: f64,
    /// Whether to format extent managers on initialization (default: true).
    /// Set to false when re-initializing to preserve on-disk data.
    pub format_on_init: bool,
}

/// Opaque handle to client GPU memory for DMA transfers.
pub struct IpcHandle {
    /// GPU memory base address.
    pub address: *mut u8,
    /// Size of the data in bytes.
    pub size: u32,
}

// SAFETY: GPU memory is accessible cross-thread via DMA engine.
// Caller guarantees the pointer stays valid for the duration of the operation.

## Component Wiring

```
DispatcherComponentV0 --> [IDispatcher provider]
                      <-- [ILogger receptacle]
                      <-- [IDispatchMap receptacle]
                      <-- [IGpuServices receptacle]
                      <-- [ISPDKEnv receptacle]
```

Block devices and extent managers are created internally during `initialize()`
based on the `DispatcherConfig` PCI addresses. The `ISPDKEnv` receptacle provides
the SPDK environment for device initialization and DMA buffer allocation.

## Preconditions

- `initialize()` must be called before any other method (except `shutdown()`).
- `dispatch_map` and `gpu_services` receptacles must be bound before `initialize()`.
- `spdk_env` receptacle must be bound for hardware mode (optional for staging-only).
- `DispatcherConfig::data_pci_addrs` must be non-empty.
- `IpcHandle::size` must be > 0.
- `prepare_store` size must be > 0.

## Postconditions

- `populate()` guarantees the entry is registered in the dispatch map before returning.
- `shutdown()` guarantees no background threads are running when it returns.
- `remove()` guarantees the dispatch map entry is removed when it returns.
- `prepare_store()` guarantees the key is visible via `check()` after return.
- `commit_store()` guarantees data is persisted to SSD when it returns.
- `cancel_store()` guarantees no resources remain allocated for the key.
- `touch()` guarantees the TSC is updated atomically; does not block on references.

## Eviction

When `max_cache_entries > 0` and the cache size exceeds `eviction_threshold × max_cache_entries`, `prepare_store` triggers a synchronous eviction cycle that removes the oldest entries (by TSC) until the count reaches the watermark. Eviction skips entries with active write references.
